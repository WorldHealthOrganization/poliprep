\usage{
pngquant_compress_single_file(
  pngquant_path,
  file,
  speed,
  png_overwrite,
  verbosity = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pngquant_path}{Character string specifying path to the pngquant
executable}

\item{file}{Character string specifying the path to the PNG file to compress}

\item{speed}{Integer. Speed/quality trade-off from 1 (brute-force) to 10
(fastest). Default is 3. Speed 10 has 5\% lower quality but is 8 times
faster.}

\item{png_overwrite}{Logical. If TRUE, will overwrite existing files.
Default is TRUE}

\item{verbosity}{Logical. Controls output verbosity. FALSE = silent,
TRUE = verbose.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{success}{Logical. TRUE if compression was successful, FALSE
otherwise}
\item{stats}{Compression statistics if successful, NULL otherwise}

A list containing:
\item{success}{Logical. TRUE if compression was successful, FALSE
otherwise}
\item{stats}{Compression statistics if successful, NULL otherwise}

\description{
Compresses a single PNG file using the pngquant utility, which performs
lossy compression to reduce file size while maintaining visual quality.

}
\details{
The function uses system parameters defined in the parent environment:
\itemize{
\item pngquant_path: Path to the pngquant executable
\item speed: Compression speed (1-11, where 1 is slowest but highest quality)
}

The function forces overwriting of the original file with the compressed
version. Status code 99 indicates that the file was already compressed.
