\description{
This function checks for suggested packages and prompts the user to install
any missing ones that are needed for full functionality. It handles both
CRAN and GitHub packages.
}
\details{
The function maintains a predefined list of suggested packages and checks if
they are installed. For missing packages, it prompts the user for
installation in interactive sessions. Special handling is included for
GitHub packages like esri2sf'.

The function uses 'cli' for user communication and handles errors gracefully
during installation attempts. In non-interactive sessions, it skips
installation and returns with a warning.
}
\note{
\itemize{
\item Function requires an interactive session for package installation
\item Some functionality may be limited if suggested packages are not installed
\item Installation errors are caught and reported but don't stop execution
}
